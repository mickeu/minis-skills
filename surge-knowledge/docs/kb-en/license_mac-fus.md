# Surge Mac Maintenance Update Subscription

This article systematically explains the rules and user rights of the Surge Mac maintenance update subscription model for reference and consultation.

***

## Why Adopt a Maintenance Update Subscription

* **Timely Delivery of New Features**

  The major version paid model often prompts developers to "hoard" features until the next paid upgrade, resulting in longer update cycles. The maintenance update subscription allows features to be released immediately upon completion, ensuring users can access new features as soon as possible.
* **Predictable Costs**

  Users only need to make a fixed payment once a year to continuously obtain the latest version, without worrying about the timing and price of the next major version.
* **Permanent Usage Rights Retained**

  Unlike purely subscription-based software, Surge Mac still offers a perpetual license: after the subscription expires, users can use the last version obtained before expiry indefinitely.
* **High Flexibility**

  You can decide whether to renew immediately based on your need for new features. If you don't require new features, you can delay subscription renewal and renew it when there is a need for new features.

## Renewal and License Upgrade

### Renewal Price

| Number of Licensed Devices | Maintenance Update Subscription Renewal (12 Months) |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 Device                   | US $19.99                                           |
| 3 Devices                  | US $29.99                                           |
| 5 Devices                  | US $45.99                                           |

* Renewal does not change the current number of licensed devices.
* If you need to increase the number of devices, you can purchase an upgrade package; the system will automatically calculate the price difference according to the remaining subscription days and unify the expiration date.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if you currently have a 1-device license, and the subscription will expire in 200 days, the fee to upgrade to a 3-device license is `$69.99 - $49.99 + $29.99 / 3 * (1 − 200 / 365) = $24.5`, that is, a price difference of `$20 + an additional 165 days of 1-device subscription fee at $4.5`, and after the upgrade, the entire license update validity will be 365 days from now.

Since the original device is renewed at the discounted subscription price of the higher tier, directly purchasing the upgrade package is more cost-effective than renewing first and then upgrading the quantity.

## Trial Policy

Every year, you are entitled to a 7-day free trial to experience the new version’s features without renewal.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Do I have to upgrade to the latest version during the subscription period to continue using the last version forever?

No, even if the subscription has expired, you can update to the last version released before expiry at any time.

#### Is the maintenance update subscription created by Surge?

The maintenance update subscription is not invented by Surge, and has long been used by many software products. It is already a mature software license model. For example, on macOS, TablePlus, ForkLift, Sketch, Tower, Kaleidoscope, and other software all use the maintenance update subscription model. Many Windows platform software also use this model.

#### How do I know about new features:

We have launched the web version of the update log, which is synchronized with the update system: <https://nssurge.com/support/mac/release-notes>, where you can see all versions’ update details and release dates.

{% hint style="info" %}
When a new version is available and your subscription has expired, there will be a subtle reminder in the event list on the main interface, which you can click to view. If you don't want to receive this message, you can click and select a suspension period for detection, or permanently disable the reminder.
{% endhint %}

#### If I encounter a serious bug in the last version before the subscription period ends, do I have to renew to fix it?

If a very serious bug appears, we will release a new version immediately upon receiving the report, and the unlock time for the new version will be consistent with the problematic version, ensuring normal use is not affected.

However, please note that compatibility updates for the latest macOS are not covered by this promise. Usually, as systems update, we need to spend a large amount of time and effort adapting (for example, to solve compatibility issues with macOS Sequoia, we rewrote the entire enhancement mode implementation using Network Extension.). This is also the meaning behind maintaining the maintenance update subscription itself.
