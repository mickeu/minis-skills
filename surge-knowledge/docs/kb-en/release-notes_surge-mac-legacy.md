## Surge Mac v5 Release Notes

#### Version 5.10.3

* Added `[General]` parameter `block-quic`, which is used to globally override the behavior of whether to block QUIC traffic. It can be set to:
  * `per-policy`: Determined by the policy's `block-quic` parameter, default value, i.e., current version behavior.
  * `all-proxy`: Overrides the proxy policy's `block-quic` parameter, blocks all
  * `all`: Overrides all policies' `block-quic` parameters, blocks all including DIRECT policy
  * `always-allow`: Overrides the proxy policy's `block-quic` parameter, allows all
* The adding new rule view can now remember previous options.
* Added dark mode support to the error page.
* Add integration support for the Dia browser.
* Bug fixes and other improvements.

#### Version 5.10.2

* Accessing the remote Dashboard of Ponte devices no longer requires Enhanced Mode to be enabled.
* Added DNS over TLS support, e.g., `tls://8.8.8.8`
* Optimize the process of adding rules through the Dashboard.
* Surge Dashboard can now remotely operate the temporary rules of the target Surge instance.
* Bug fixes and other improvements.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.10.2-3235-9255a55c4af59cbf0ed01b245ef86dcc.zip>

#### Version 5.10.1

* When enabling the HTTP capture switch, all active connections will now be forcibly interrupted to ensure that no requests are missed due to existing long connections.
* Optimized compatibility with some QUIC clients, such as Lark.
* Fixed an issue where download data bytes in statistics was incorrect after modifying the request HTTP using scripts or other mechanisms.
* Adjusted the priority of processing logic when forwarding QUIC. Now, for a proxy policy that does not support UDP forwarding, it will prioritize considering QUIC Block before falling back to DIRECT or REJECT.
* Fixed an issue where utun devices could not be used when binding the outbound interface.
* Fixed an issue where repeated notifications might continuously occur during Ponte Server retry failures.
* Resolved an issue where a specific request forwarded by Surge Ponte might get stuck under certain networks.
* Bug fixes and other improvements.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.10.1-3207-1e925800c695a40e8a34ceca6d856b0d.zip>

#### Version 5.10.0

**New Feature: Port Forwarding**

Example

```
[Port Forwarding]
0.0.0.0:6841 localhost:3306 policy=SQL-Server-Proxy
```

The policy parameter is optional; if not specified, the standard proxy matching will be used to determine the policy.

This feature is commonly used in development and debugging scenarios such as connecting to servers like MariaDB using SSH.

**#!REQUIREMENT upgrade**

* Now provides three simple notations: #!IOS-ONLY, #!MACOS-ONLY, and #!TVOS-ONLY.
* Content disabled by this end-of-line comment can now be displayed and edited in the UI. It will appear as disabled when conditions are not met, and if enabled, restrictions will be automatically removed.

Example

```
DOMAIN,reject.com,REJECT #!MACOS-ONLY
```

**\[Host] Optimization**

\[Host] section supports configuration using DOMAIN-SET and RULE-SET to improve matching efficiency. Use case:

```
[Host]
DOMAIN-SET:https://example.com/domains.txt = server:https://doh.com/dns-query
RULE-SET:https://example.com/rules.txt = server:https://doh.com/dns-query
```

**Other Improvements**

* Optimize using Smart policy groups as the underlying proxy. Now, in this usage scenario, the characteristics of Smart policy groups can be fully utilized.
* Surge Ponte can now automatically retry to recover after an abnormal NAT type appears.
* Bug fixes and other improvements.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.10.0-3195-d468f4e99b54bcde0432f2b5a0e38296.zip>

#### Version 5.9.3

* Bug fixes and other improvements.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.9.3-3122-0244efc5738b3cebde7c87c556cfddb8.zip>

#### Version 5.9.2

* The menu bar icon can now display the outbound mode.
* Fixed some issues related to Ponte.
* Fixed the issue where error messages on the DHCP configuration page sometimes could not be displayed, preventing further actions.
* Fixed an issue where the \[Host] entry configured for .local domain names might be invalid.
* Optimized the proxy and rule editing pages; parameters that are not editable in the UI will now also be retained.
* Other bug fixes.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.9.2-3098-643c195efc1153b6d4993af6bba73a59.zip>

#### Version 5.9.0

#### New Features

* Added pre-matching rules for low-overhead request rejection. Please refer to the documentation for details. <https://manual.nssurge.com/policy/reject.html>
* Body Rewrite supports using JQ expressions to manipulate JSON.
* The shadowsocks protocol adds support for the `2022-blake3-aes-256-gcm` and `2022-blake3-aes-128-gcm` encryption modes

#### Improvements

* The URL-REGEX rule now supports `extended-matching` tags.
* Allow the use of Ponte policy as an underlying proxy.
* Modify the termination logic of HTTP scripts. If a request needs to be interrupted, use $done({abort: true}). Other failures will not modify or terminate the request.
* Overall optimization and improvement of UDP forwarding.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fix the issue where DNS requests cannot select the correct interface according to the routing table in enhanced mode.
* Fix the issue of not being able to obtain system routes on macOS 12.
* Fix the issue where determining the existence of IPv6 might be incorrect in some cases.
* Fix the issue where an incorrect message might sometimes indicate that the proxy settings have been modified by another program.
* Other bug fixes.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.9.0-3025-f8d045da66079150d4a281ed3770b3f6.zip>

#### Version 5.8.2

* Fix the issue where IPv6 VIF cannot take over requests when the `gateway-restricted-to-lan` parameter is enabled.
* DNS lookup of `use-application-dns.net` will return NXDOMAIN, causing Firefox to automatically disable application DNS, (i.e., DoH). Using encrypted DNS directly in the browser will prevent Surge from correctly obtaining the requested domain names.
* Bug fixes and minor improvements.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.8.2-2946-b739968f1d90da3b755d3bf82941e8c2.zip>

#### Version 5.8.1

* New parameters: proxy-restricted-to-lan/gateway-restricted-to-lan It has been found that some users, due to a lack of understanding of network security knowledge, accidentally expose proxy and gateway services to the Internet (e.g., configured DMZ). Therefore, these two parameters have been added to restrict proxy and gateway services to only accept devices from the current subnet. These two parameters are enabled by default.
* Fix the compatibility between enhanced mode and PPPoE direct dialing.
* Support using ETag to avoid downloading duplicate data when requesting external resources.
* Surge now supports handling the system's DNS search domain settings.
* Other bug fixes and compatibility improvements.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.8.1-2929-5220af95366dfacec7ca84cb8ddd122c.zip>

#### Version 5.8.0

**Network Extension**

* Due to numerous issues arising from the traditional utun takeover solution in newer system versions, starting from Surge Mac 5.8.0, Surge Mac will use Network Extension as the enhanced mode to take over the system network.
* The minimum system version requirement for Surge Mac is raised to macOS 12.
* Due to different required permissions, manual authorization operations is needed after updating.
* The `vif-mode` parameter will no longer be effective.
* Enhanced mode can now be used in conjunction with network sharing functionality, meaning you can directly create a Wi-Fi managed by Surge (requires wired network)

**Port Hopping**

Hysteria2 and TUIC protocol now support port hopping to improve ISP's QoS issues with UDP. See the server documentation for details.

`Proxy = hysteria2, 1.2.3.4, 443, password=pwd, port-hopping="1234;5000-6000;7044;8000-9000", port-hopping-interval=30`

After configuring the `port-hopping` parameter, the primary port number configured in the front will no longer be effective.

Parameters:

* `port-hopping`: Used to configure the range of ports. Separated by commas and supports ranges configured with a hyphen.
* `port-hopping-interval`: The interval for changing port numbers. Defaults to 30 seconds

**Other Improvments**

* Due to the large amount of features requiring permissions in the new macOS system, a dedicated page has been added for managing system permissions.
* The `syslib` keyword for local DNS mapping can now be used in enhanced mode. However, in non-enhanced mode, the resolution is entirely handled by the system. In enhanced mode, Surge resolves it using the system's DNS address.
* Added `[General]` parameter `show-error-page`, which is used to control whether Surge's HTTP error page is displayed when an error occurs. This parameter is enabled by default, and the behavior is consistent with previous versions.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.8.0-2900-6379c9d5240ae1555772aed2eb977e69.zip>

#### Version 5.7.5

* The panel is now available in Surge Mac.
* DNS Forwarding Subsystem Optimization
  * When the domain of a DNS query is one that should not be forwarded to the public network (e.g., .home.arpa, 1.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa), it will automatically determine the upstream DNS address and only forward to LAN DNS servers.
  * Surge can now correctly respond to PTR requests for fake IPs, meaning that using the `dig -x 198.18.23.87` command can be used to determine the original domain name corresponding to a fake IP.
  * The DNS forwarder will now forward DNS requests to specific upstream servers based on `[Host]` section configuration.
  * Directly respond with NOTIMP to unsupported DNS-SD PTR requests for fake IPs, without forwarding.
* When adding a rule for the current webpage, you can choose to add to an existing ruleset.
* Bug fixes.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.7.5-2826-4f19761fb2275ebbe2acf43907bd9371.zip>

#### Version 5.7.4

* Due to the sudden shutdown of a public STUN server that Surge Ponte relies on, resulting in the unavailability of Surge Ponte, we have carried out an emergency replacement. Additionally, we will build our own STUN server in the future to avoid such issues.
* Enhance compatibility with VPN and multiple network cards

  In previous versions, if the enhanced mode was enabled, all outgoing packets would be forced to use the primary interface due to Surge overriding the system's routing table. This bypassed the routing table to avoid creating a loop.

  However, this also caused issues where packets could not be sent from the correct interface in cases with multiple network cards or other VPNs.

  This version improves on that design. Now, in enhanced mode, Surge will automatically check routes and still use standard routing for TCP/UDP packets if there are higher priority sub-routes present, enhancing compatibility.
* Fix an issue where DOMAIN-SUFFIX rules may become invalid if duplicate DOMAIN and DOMAIN-SUFFIX rules are included in the rule set.
* Other bug fixes.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.7.4-2806-afe67661ef616b7bbab189dec1473b68.zip>

#### Version 5.7.3

* Now you can see the number of times a rule has been used in the rule list.
* Optimized the implementation method of blocking QUIC traffic to increase the likelihood of clients correctly falling back.
* The Smart group will use the SUBSTITUTE policy (DIRECT) instead of failing directly when there are no sub-policies.
* Fixed an issue where the `server-cert-fingerprint-sha256` parameter was not effective for TLS-like protocols with sni=off settings.
* Added a new rule type `HOSTNAME-TYPE`, used to determine the type of request hostname. Optional values are: `IPv4`, `IPv6`, `DOMAIN`, `SIMPLE`. (`SIMPLE` refers to hostnames without a dot, such as `localhost`)
* Optimized DNS request logs. Now more information is displayed. Additionally, if DIRECT policy connects directly without triggering DNS in the rule system, related DNS logs can still be shown.
* When deleting a policy that is being used by a policy group, it is now allowed to delete it directly and automatically remove it from all policy groups.
* Bug fixes and other Improvements.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.7.3-2785-048c0bdc5ee2b05dab39852d51a19ff4.zip>

#### Version 5.7.2

* Optimize the matching performance of ASN rules in the rule set.
* Fix the issue where FINAL rules cannot be edited through UI.
* Fix the problem that invalid cron expressions would cause scripts to be executed repeatedly.
* Optimized the management mechanism of the script engine.
* Other minor issues fixed.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.7.2-2762-9a963758f386b5da00e7744b2a7f254d.zip>

#### Version 5.7.1

* Optimize the matching performance of small rule sets, especially evident on older model CPUs.
* The external resource update page can display error information generated by rule set processing.
* Automatically ignore invalid empty lines in the rule set.
* Corrected the issue where applying temporary rules and then experiencing a policy change does not disrupt existing connections.
* Corrected the issue when using Ponte policy within Smart group, if the target device is itself, it failed to automatically switch to DIRECT policy.
* Corrected the problem of incorrect time displayed in request logs for Ponte device requests.
* Corrected crashes that may occur when external policy groups change.
* Fixed an issue where configuration upgrade functionality did not correctly take effect for managed configurations and enterprise configurations.
* During Smart group initialization phase, no longer displays most frequently used tags to avoid misunderstanding.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.7.1-2757-e7b680d5dc23e1258188adc4d81116d7.zip>

#### Version 5.7.0

#### Smart Group

This is a new type of policy group, driven by our carefully designed algorithm engine, which can automatically select the appropriate policy from the sub-policies of this policy group. The goal of the Smart policy group is to replace the original automatic testing groups (url/load-balance/fallback), greatly optimizing the experience while minimizing the need for manual intervention in policy groups. Users only need to put the available policies into this group.

For details, see: <https://kb.nssurge.com/surge-knowledge-base/guidelines/smart-group>

#### Rule System

* Overall performance optimization of the rule system.
* Significant optimization of the indexing algorithm in large domain rule sets, improving the search efficiency by more than ten times for rule sets with more than 100,000 rules.
* Corrected the issue where sub-rules of logical rules within a rule set could not be covered by the `no-resolve` and `extended-matching` parameters of the rule set.
* Added a new rule type `DOMAIN-WILDCARD`, supporting `?` and `*` domain name matching.
* `DOMAIN-SET` and `RULE-SET` are changed to strict validation. If there are invalid lines in the file, the entire rule set will be invalidated to avoid problems caused by misuse.

#### IPv6

* The behavior of the `ipv6-vif` parameter has been modified. When set to always, IPv6 functionality will be enabled even if `ipv6=true` is not set.
* Added a warning for the `ipv6-vif=always` parameter.
* Adjusted the automatic retry mechanism. Accessing IPv6 addresses in a non-IPv6 network will no longer enter the retry process, and the request will fail immediately (solving the problem of some applications stalling when IPv6 VIF is enabled in a non-IPv6 environment, but the application will still continue to send IPv6 requests).

#### Other Optimizations

* Enhanced `$notification.post`, adding support for media resources, sound hints, and automatic dismissal.
* Optimized WireGuard failure handling.
* Reduced the power consumption of the TUIC protocol during sleep.
* Improved the precision of time statistics in the request log system, now accurate to µs level.
* Optimized various abnormal retry mechanisms, avoiding high resource usage caused by continuous retry in the face of some specific problems. For operations that need to be retried continuously (such as WireGuard reconnection, Ponte server reporting to iCloud), Surge will now retry after 0.1s, 0.5s, 1s, 5s, 10s, 30s after an error.
* Optimized the caching system for external resources.
* Added the profile line modifier `#!REQUIREMENT`.

#### Detail Adjustments

* Limited the length of logs that can be written to request notes in debug mode by scripts.
* Changed the default UDP test target to 1.0.0.1.
* If incorrect types of fields are passed when using API in scripts, it will result in script errors.
* After the script is completed or times out, unfinished $httpClient will no longer call the callback function.

#### Issue Fixes

* Fixed the issue where the HTTP Body captured from remote devices could not be read in the Dashboard.
* Fixed the problem where Header Rewrite rules could not match URLs based on the Host field.
* Corrected the issue where ip-version and tos parameters could not take effect when testing proxies.
* Fixed the crash issue caused by mistakenly passing null when executing scripts via HTTP-API.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.7.0-2724-acaafccea020f6afdc758c83057ffcbb.zip>

#### Version 5.6.0

**New Feature**

* Mock (Map Local) feature fully enhanced.
  * Added data types such as `text`, `tiny-gif`, `base64` for inline direct data return.
  * Added `status-code` parameter
  * UI related configurations have not been updated yet. For usage methods, see the documentation: <https://manual.nssurge.com/http-processing/mock.html>
* When the parameter `encrypted-dns-follow-outbound-mode=true` is configured, if a DoH/DoQ/DoH3 connection matches a proxy server using a domain name, and if there is a DNS Local Mapping record for that proxy server's domain name containing an IP address or traditional DNS server, then it is permissible to query through that proxy server. (Querying DNS through a proxy server will break CDN optimization, leading to severe slowness when loading images and videos. Unless there are very special requirements and it is not necessary to configure in this way, domain rules should be used to ensure requests are directly queried by the proxy server.)
* Added feature Body Rewrite, see documentation for details: <https://manual.nssurge.com/http-processing/body-rewrite.html-> Added recognition for STUN packets, which can be matched using PROTOCOL,STUN. Similar to QUIC, to ensure compatibility, PROTOCOL,UDP can also continue to match STUN traffic.

**Enhancements**

* Optimized request logging. Now the specific rules matched for URL Rewrite and Header Rewrite will be displayed.
* Adjusted the logic of how the DNS engine handles empty results. Now when multiple DNS servers are configured, it no longer waits for all servers to respond with empty results in order to avoid additional waiting when AAAA records do not exist. (However, since the behavior of DNS servers may vary in different environments, observe whether this change causes side effects; please provide feedback if issues arise causing abnormal results.)
* Canceled warning notifications when ICMP exceeds limits

#### Fixes

* Enhanced compatibility when decompressing HTTP Body.
* Fixed a crash in Surge caused by passing some incorrect types of parameters in scripts.
* Adapted to new system restrictions, fixed the issue where selecting to display the main window is ineffective in some cases
* Fixed compatibility issues with non-https WebSocket in proxy mode and the new version of Safari

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.6.0-2611-efc3b7ebb3872061e9a6a4917742e203.zip>

#### Version 5.5.0

**Module**

* Added several new official modules; official modules can now be dynamically updated.
* Modules have a new classification field for convenient access and categorization in the UI.
* Modules now accept parameter tables, supporting multiple parameters. Parameters will be used to modify module content through text replacement.

**Script**

* New script execution engine. Optimized execution performance and memory usage.
* $httpClient has added several practical parameters. For more details on the updates above, see the documentation.

**Enhancements**

* New parameter: always-raw-tcp-keywords. For usage, refer to documentation.
* Added SRC-PORT rule for matching client port numbers.
* IN-PORT/SRC-PORT/DEST-PORT three rules are categorized as port number rule types, supporting three kinds of expressions:
  * Directly writing the port number, such as IN-PORT,6153
  * Port number closed interval: such as DEST-PORT,10000-20000
  * Using >, <, <=, >= operators, such as SRC-PORT,>=50000
* The UI can now maintain pure empty lines from original configurations after editing.

**Fixes**

* Corrected a detail issue with QUIC flow control and optimized latency performance for Ponte/TUIC/Hysteria2 protocols.
* After editing a single rule, the notification-related parameters will be retained.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.5.0-2586-ed7ce88d6b2a286537ff5402324cb7fe.zip>

#### Version 5.4.3

* Rewrote the virtual IP database, now the database can automatically clean up data based on the last time of use.
* Fixed some issues that may occur when using Snell v4 with WireGuard and enabling reuse.
* For DNS requests with illegal domain names, an empty result response will be generated instead of being directly ignored.
* `tun-included-routes` and `tun-excluded-routes` parameters now supports IPv6 CIDR block when IPv6 VIF is enabled.
* Support configuring no-resolve for built-in rule sets/Inline rule sets.
* Surge Ponte connections no longer validate peer addresses to ensure normal operation in certain special scenarios.
* Bug fixes.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.4.3-2540-511d4692c27626166bbcbb61fdd56bc8.zip>

#### Version 5.4.2

* Fixed an issue that the built-in rule set LAN failed to correctly trigger DNS resolution.
* Fixed an issue that could cause a crash when handling some malformed UDP packets.
* Fixed an issue that the system that could potentially misjudge has been restarted, causing the Fake IP table to be cleared.
* Fixed a compatibility issue with a specific HTTP server.
* Compatible with some non-standard SOCKS5 UDP server implementations, adjusted errors to warnings.
* Other bug fixes.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.4.2-2502-001dc6b9672b7e79f92ca5cd3be6baf2.zip>

#### Version 5.4.1

**Rule Engine Optimizations**

* The implementation of RULE-SET and DOMAIN-SET has been completely rewritten. Now, Surge automatically preprocesses and indexes rule sets during resource updates, significantly increasing the matching speed.
  1. There is no longer any difference in performance and memory usage between RULE-SET and DOMAIN-SET types of rule sets, allowing flexible usage.
  2. There is no longer a restriction in DOMAIN-SET rule sets that prevents the use of eTLDs.
  3. The matching speed for DOMAIN, DOMAIN-SUFFIX, IP-CIDR, and IP-CIDR6 rules in RULE-SET has been greatly improved.
  4. A DOMAIN/DOMAIN-SUFFIX rule set with approximately 100,000 entries used to take 100ms for a single match in the old version; now, it only takes single-digit ms.
  5. An IP-CIDR rule set with approximately 10,000 entries used to take about 0.1ms for a single match in the old version. The new version only needs 0.0002ms, an improvement of about 500 times. The performance improvement for IP-CIDR6 rules is even greater.
  6. In the new version, building a regional IP address collection using the IP-CIDR rule set offers the same performance as directly using the internal GEOIP rule.
  7. The Inline Ruleset added in the previous version does not benefit from this optimization, but there is virtually no difference at the scale of hundreds of entries.
  8. In previous versions, rules within a Ruleset were matched one by one from top to bottom. If rules requiring DNS resolution were included, DNS would only be triggered when starting to match that sub-rule. In the new version, if any rule requiring DNS resolution is included in the rule set, DNS resolution will occur before testing that rule set. (In most cases, there is no difference)
* Main ruleset matching efficiency has been slightly optimized.
* The efficiency of IP-CIDR6 rules has been significantly improved even in non-indexed situations.
* RULE-SET rules can now be configured directly with parameters no-resolve and extended-matching, which are equivalent to configuring all sub-rules with these parameters.
* DOMAIN-SET rule sets also support configuration with extended-matching.

**Minor Optimizations**

* Now, when performing MITM, the certificate used for signing will be sent to the client together, to support using intermediate certificates for MITM.
* All comments (at the beginning and end of lines) can now use `#`, `//`, `;` three common comment symbols.
* Profile error message prompt optimization, now it can give the exact line number where the error occurred more accurately.
* Optimize Surge Ponte error handling process, correct the issue where device information is not automatically updated under certain errors.
* Bug fixes.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.4.1-2495-041f47425e9ecf56580562ce01560448.zip>

#### Version 5.4.0

**New Features**

* Protocol sniffing

  Requests to port 80 and 443 will wait for the client to send the first packet, then extract the SNI and other information for the rule system to judge.

  * `DOMAIN`, `DOMAIN-SUFFIX`, `DOMAIN-KEYWORD` rules add an optional parameter called `extended-matching`. When this parameter is enabled, the rule will try to match both the SNI and the HTTP Host Header (or :authority).
  * Added a parameter called `always-raw-tcp-hosts`, used to forcibly turn off active protocol detection for specific hostnames.
* New proxy protocol support: Hysteria 2

  Hysteria 2 is a proxy protocol optimized for unstable and packet-loss-prone network environments, based on UDP/QUIC.
* Automatic QUIC blocking

  Since most proxy protocols are not suitable for forwarding QUIC traffic, Surge will now automatically block QUIC traffic to make it fallback to HTTPS/TCP protocol, ensuring performance. For QUIC traffic that hits the MITM hostname, it will also be automatically rejected.
* ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) support for QUIC-based protocols

  Significantly improved the performance of the Vector(Surge Ponte)/TUIC/Hysteria 2 protocol.

**Optimizations**

* Reworked HTTP capture functionality
  * The related settings are no longer stored in the configuration, the `[Replica]` section has been deprecated.
  * Added an automatic shut-off setting after turning on the capture switch, which can automatically stop capturing based on time, size, or the number of requests.
  * Added automatic activation of MITM after turning on the capture switch, which can be additionally turned on for specific hostnames. (Even if the main MITM switch is off).
  * Added an option to only save HTTP/HTTPS requests after turning on the capture switch.
* Improved compatibility with some non-standard protocols.
* When testing the Ponte policy, the test URL has been changed from `proxy-test-url` to `internet-test-url`.
* Following the WireGuard protocol standard recommendation, WireGuard handshake packets will now be tagged with 0x88 (AF41) DSCP to increase the success rate.
* When forwarding UDP packets via WireGuard, it supports retaining the TOS(DSCP/ECN) tag of packets inside the tunnel.
* Based on the WireGuard protocol standard recommendation, Surge will copy the ECN tag from packets inside the tunnel to packets outside. When receiving packets with an ECN tag, they will be strictly merged according to RFC6040. (`ecn=true` must be set for the policy).
* UDP NAT can close the UDP session early based on ICMP messages.
* Improved PMTU support for QUIC.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed the issue where the external resources of rule sets needed to be reloaded to take effect after updates.
* After a network switch, it will forcefully break the original long connection of DoH/DoQ/DoH3 to avoid obtaining results that are not suitable for the current network environment.
* Fixed the issue where invalid certificates might cause the key store interface to crash.
* When performing MITM on HTTPS requests that directly connect using an IP address, the IP address should not be sent as SNI, as this might cause compatibility issues.
* Other bug fixes.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v5/Surge-5.2.1-2333-ef97cd79e935d838387dc99712fb38b3.zip>

#### Version 5.2.0

* Due to the fixed size of macOS network stack memory, when the network stack buffer is exhausted, the kernel will automatically close the program with the highest occupancy to release resources. This problem may occur when using Surge to take over P2P downloaders. This version will automatically check for this issue and enter safe mode automatically.
* Surge VIF engine has been upgraded to v3, no longer relying on Packet Filter (pf), solving compatibility issues with virtual machines and network sharing functions. At the same time, connection number limits have been added to avoid system resource exhaustion caused by excessive concurrent requests.
* Add a connection limiter for single processes and single devices to avoid consuming large amounts of resources for individual devices.
* Support for QUIC's PMTU discovery, which improves the performance of Surge Ponte and TUIC protocols.

#### Version 5.0.3

* Added UDP relay support for the VMess protocol
  * Since the VMess server-side supports UDP forwarding by default, there's no need to add extra parameters to use it.
  * Due to design flaws in the VMess protocol, when using VMess to forward UDP traffic, P2P scenarios may not work, such as voice calls, online gaming, etc. Therefore, it is not recommended to use the VMess protocol.
* SSH protocol now supports specifying the server's public key fingerprint. Check the manual for more information.

#### Version 4.10.1 (Dec 3, 2022)

**New Feature**

* Gaming Optimization Mode: `udp-priority = true`. Enabling it will prioritize UDP packets when the system load is very high, and packet processing is delayed.
* SOCKS5 proxy now supports UDP forwarding, as the server side does not consistently support UDP forwarding, the parameter udp-relay=true needs to be explicitly configured.
* The `ipv6-vif` parameter now supports `always` and `auto` like Surge iOS. If set to `auto`, IPv6 VIF will only be enabled if a valid Internet IPv6 address (2000::/3) exists.

**Minor Improvements**

* URL regular expressions for Script, Rewrite, Mock, etc. will try to match URLs constructed in many different ways (e.g. Host field in Header) to solve the problem that some apps use custom DNS logic to request directly to IP addresses.
* Removed the silencing mechanism after UDP forwarding errors to avoid extra waiting time after switching networks.
* The IPv6 switch no longer prevents direct access to IPv6 addresses when turned off. The switch is now limited to controlling whether the DNS Client requests AAAA records.
* Automatic disabling of AAAA queries due to DNS issues will be prompted in the Event Center instead of just in the logs.
* Fixed handling issue of generating IPv6 fragmentation when forwarding IPv6 UDP packets via WireGuard.
* The external policy group will skip the line and continue processing when it encounters invalid content instead of returning an error directly.
* Adjusted the buffering mechanism of raw TCP forwarding to avoid conflicts with some apps.
* Fixed REJECT requests not being marked as failed under MITM H2.
* Adjusted the output text under diagnostics.
* Other bug fixes.

  * If the parameter is not set, MITM is enabled for all clients. A equivalent to `client-source-address = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`
  * `127.0.0.1` should be included if you want to enable MITM for the current device.

**WireGuard**

* WireGuard now supports IPv6 tunneling.
  * Use parameter `self-ip-v6` to assign an IPv6 address for Surge.
  * You may configure `self-ip` and `self-ip-v6` to utilize the IPv4 & IPv6 dual stack, or just one of them to use the single stack.

<https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v4/Surge-4.1.0-1298-f07b1b8713b2397518f4b252b5786452.zip>

#### Version 4.0.5

**Policy Group**

In this release, we completely refactored the policy group functionality, bringing the following changes:

1. The url-test/fallback/load-balance policy group can no longer be configured with a specific testing URL but with a global testing URL or a policy-configured testing URL. The policy's test results can be used directly in all policy group decisions, eliminating the need to retest each policy group individually.
2. All types of policy groups support mixed nesting. The only requirement is that no circular references can be used.
3. When a group policy is used as a sub-policy of the url-test/fallback/load-balance group.
   * The latency of the select/url-test/fallback/ssid group is the latency of the selected policy.
   * The latency of the load-balance group is the average of the latencies of all available policies.
4. The timeout parameter of a policy group marks policies with latency exceeding this parameter as unavailable when making decisions for the group. But the maximum time taken to test the policy group is controlled by the global test-timeout parameter. (Default is 5s)
5. When testing a group due to decision making, all sub-policies that the group may use are tested, including sub-policies of the sub-policy group.
6. You may use no-alert=true parameter to suppress notifications for particular groups.

**Cloud Notification**

You can receive the notifications on iOS devices. Enable this option first and then configure it on Surge iOS. The two device must use a same iCloud account.

**Minor Changes**

* Bug fixes.

**New rule type: DOMAIN-SET**

* DOMAIN-SET is just like RULE-SET. But it is designed a large number of rules and highly efficient.
* Unlike RULE-SET, you can only write hostnames (domain or IP address) in it. One hostname per line.
* You may use "." prefix to include all sub-domains.

**Changes in SRC-IP**

* SRC-IP rule now supports IP-CIDR for both IPv4 and IPv6.

**Changes in DNS over HTTPS**

* From this version, if DNS-over-HTTPS is configured, the traditional DNS will only be used to test the connectivity and resolve the domain in the DOH URL.
